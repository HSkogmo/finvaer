Finv√¶r (English)
==================

An app that finds nearby locations with warm weather.
Made because of tweets from @havareidslott and @nrkbeta which requested and app with this functionality.

# Function

The app will look up the users current location, and from that use an API to retrieve all nearby locations within a pre-defined proximity.
It will then use a second API to check up the current weather forecasts for the retrieved areas. If any the of the forecasts matches our
"nice weather" requirement, it will then be showed on the list of "nearby areas with nice weather".
